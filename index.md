# MA5 LLM Guardrail Project Inspiration

**By**: Phu Dang (pndang@ucsd.edu)

**Section**: B07 | Mentors: Abed El-Husseini, Nimu Sidhu

**Industry Partner**: Deloitte

**Host Institution**: Halicioglu Data Science Institute

**Prospective Data Providers**: UC San Diego, Qualcomm Institute, Locbit, and more

**Q & A**:

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I personally was very intrigued and interested in learning novel enterprise applications of LLMs and LLM guardrails by leveraging the unique lectures, guest talks, office hours, and exposure provided by my industry mentors at Deloitte. Not only exciting and novel applications, what I am interested in exploring most were the relevant **challenges** facing the wide and effective adoption of Generative AI, specifically large language models, at enterprises. This is because challenges are important problems, which provide **opportunitites** to provide a novel solution. Three of such challenges that I plan to tackle across my Q1 and Q2 projects are (1) scattered, multimodal data sources, (2) IoT data payload privacy, and (3) risk-mitigation for chatbot-user interactions. 

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**

A central part of my Quarter 2 project will be conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the chatbot-user interaction flows. Effectively executing this part will allow my team to architect a system that is useful, robust, fault tolerant, and achieve our overarching goal of mitigating risks for Generative AI. Specifically, we will spend much effort figuring out the different situations users may be in as they interact with the LLM, different prospective scenarios of data leakage/risk/brand harm, and how we want to address the prior point, such as returning a controlled/scripted response for safety or judiciously deny service. By figuring this roadmap of relevant interaction scenarios our users may face, we aim to create a powerful and exciting LLM-based tool that enhances the relationship between our users and their data.
